In this world, a new type of internet should connect any objects, any devices, any cyber-physical systems, any firms, companies, anyone &hellip;i.e. anything! This is the basic idea of the term: Internet of Anything (IoA).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet of Anything is the interconnection of any things (devices, systems), anyone, anywhere and anytime within the existing Internet infrastructure.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation will start with a short discussion on the evolution of Internet. The next part will provide a structured, systematic overview of the numerous concepts and technologies linked to modern Internet technology; Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of People (IoP), Internet of Brains (IoB), Internet of Robots (IoR), Internet of Health IoH), Internet of Everything (IoE).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet of Clouds (IoC) or shortly Intercloud as the high-level combination of Internet of Anything and Cloud Technology is also discussed. Intercloud represents the next logical phase in computing enabling complex applications, optimized performance and enhanced reliability. A roadmap for the near future, describing development trends and emerging application areas will be also presented.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key feature of Internet of Anything is the connection of the physical and the virtual world by using 3D Internet. The last part of the presentation summarizes the results and ideas of a newly developed software engine, called MAXWHERE that provides effective working environments with spatial (Virtual Reality) multimedia arrangement and Intelligent System of Systems connectivity.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fundamental idea behind MAXWHERE is the generalization of the Document Object Model (DOM) introducing the Where Object Model (WOM) concept that covers the conventional WEB contents as well as the VR/AR building blocks in a coherent way.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical applications of MAXWHERE includes industrial monitoring and facility support, context-based collaborative working environment, industrial training, and Interactive live presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>About the Speaker:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/Resources/Images/SubDomain/icsse2017/RUDAS_03.jpg\" style=\"height:294px; width:200px\" />&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Imre J.

Here, you&rsquo;ll find eating stalls inside the market where you can get a taste of hawker-style Vietnamese cuisine or simply cool off with a cold drink when the bargaining becomes too much. The market is big, difficult to navigate at times and certainly best avoided during the hottest part of the day but all the same its well worth a look. When night falls, restaurants around the perimeter of the market open their doors creating a vibrant street side scene filling the air with the scents of wok-fried noodles, barbecued fish and meats.

Chefs will cook in front of you with an endless array of cuisine choices including vegetarian noodles, fresh seafood, crispy rice pancakes and steamed cakes. You will be in great local company as most of the places thrive with locals enjoying a bite to eat and a quick drink on their way home from work. For shopping heaven head to the market preferably early morning to pick up some bargains including lacquer ware, bamboo goods, arts and crafts. Also on sale are clothes, textiles, luggage, watches and an assortment of electronic goods. Spices, nuts and local fruits heavily scent the air which is also filled with the chatter of tourists and locals haggling for bargains. Do note however that some items will be strictly fixed price. Ben Thanh Market is situated in District 1 in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City at the intersection of Le Loi, Ham Ngh, Tan Hung and Le Lai streets. Shops close late afternoon with shopping best done in the morning before the heat of the day hits. The market is one of Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s most famous landmarks and is known by all taxi drivers, although if you are staying downtown check first to see if you can walk to it from your hotel as it&rsquo;s very centrally located.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market/allParagraphs/04/image/ben-thanh-market-inside.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nRead more at: http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market.htm?cid=ch:OTH:001<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Bitexco Financial Tower &amp; Sky Deck in Ho Chi Minh</strong><br />\r\nOpening Hours: The Sky Deck is open daily from 09:30-21:30<br />\r\nLocation: 36 Ho Tung Mau Street in District 1<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHo Chi Minh City&rsquo;s Bitexco Financial Tower &amp; Sky Deck stands 262 metres high at the centre of the city&rsquo;s business district and offers visitors an unparalleled city view from its Sky Deck.

Located in Paris Square, the name Notre Dame was given after the installation of the statue &lsquo;Peaceful Notre Dame&rsquo; in 1959. In 1962, the Vatican conferred the Cathedral status as a basilica and gave it the official name of Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Measuring almost 60 metres in height, the cathedral&rsquo;s distinctive neo-Romanesque features include the all-red brick fa&ccedil;ade (which were imported from Marseille), stained glass windows, two bell towers containing six bronze bells that still ring to this day, and a peaceful garden setting in the middle of downtown Ho Chi Minh City District 1.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/notre-dame-cathedral/allParagraphs/0/image/notre-dame-cathedral-01.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Virgin Mary statue also stands in front of Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral, which locals claimed to have shed tears in October 2005.

This image is one of the most famous pictures depicting the Reunification Palace which has seen a rich and varied history and once served as the base of the US-backed Vietnamese General Ngo Dinh Diem during the Vietnam War, until his assassination in 1963. The palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975 with two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Originally the site of the Nordom Palace also known as the Governor&rsquo;s Palace its first role was as a home and workplace for the then French Governor of Cochinchina. The Reunification Palace is a landmark not to be missed by any tourist visiting Ho Chi Minh City. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the palace hides secret rooms, antique furniture and a command bunker within its eerie corridors. The Reunification Palace is still in use to host occasions including APEC summits and national events of significant importance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/reunification-palace/pagePropertiesImage/reunification-palace-saigon.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:451px\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Saigon Opera House</strong><br />\r\nLocation: 7 Lam Son Square, District 1, HCMC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Saigon Opera House in Ho Chi Minh is an elegant colonial building at the intersection of Le Loi and Dong Khoi Street in District 1, very close to the famous Notre Dame Cathedral and the classic Central Post Office. The restored three-storey 800-seat Opera House was built in 1897 and is used for staging not only opera but also a wide range of performing arts including ballet, musical concerts, Vietnamese traditional dance and plays.

The entrance is through a vaulted archway that is kept in immaculate condition; inside, expect swathes of red velvet, classical friezes and hardwood floors. Although the official name of the building is The Municipal Theatre of Ho Chi Minh it is by far more commonly known as the Saigon Opera House and after the restoration work in 1995, the building is just as it was at the turn of the 19th Century.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/opera-house/allParagraphs/0/image2/Ho-Chi-Minh-Opera-House-3.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:446px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/Resources/ImagesPortal/HomePage/tinkhac.png\" /><a href=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/ArticleId/242b6486-aeb4-472f-b74f-779069bbd957/#\">OTHERS</a></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n'),(19,'home','<p><br />\r\n<strong>WELCOME TO ICSSE 2017</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems Science and Engineering has emerge<span style=\"background-color:#9b59b6\">d as a research </span>field that cove<span style=\"background-color:#2ecc71\">rs a wide spectrum of modern technology.
